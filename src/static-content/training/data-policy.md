### General 
By default, uploaded content will be stored indefinitely with the exception of input and output files related to model training that occurs from Civitai.

### Training Job Data Retention
**Input Files (Training Datasets)**
You may upload images and/or text files to be used for training your model. By default, this data will be persisted only until the training job is completed, unless you elect to share your dataset. Note that any captions provided to our system will later be available as metadata on the output model file.


**Output Files (Sample Images and Model Files)**
The images and models that result from completion of training will be retained for 30 days after the completion of the training job.
