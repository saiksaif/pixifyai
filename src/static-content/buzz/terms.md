**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BUZZ TERMS CAREFULLY:**

These Buzz Terms and Conditions (“Buzz Terms”) govern your receipt and use of Buzz through the Service and are Additional Terms under the Civitai Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”), which is a legally binding contract between you and Civitai and incorporated into these Buzz Terms by this reference. Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Buzz Terms will have the meanings set forth elsewhere in the Terms of Service.

**What is Buzz?** “Buzz” is the official virtual credits of the Services. Users may acquire Buzz by (i) purchasing or otherwise receiving Buzz from Civitai; (ii) receiving tips and transfers from other Users on the Service, and (iii) earning Buzz as reward from a contest, bounty, or other eligible activities with respect to the Service. Buzz may be used on the Service in several ways: (i) tipping creators to show appreciation for their work; (ii) posting bounties and offering Buzz as a reward; (iii) using Buzz to train LoRA models with the Civitai’s LoRA Trainer; (iv) accessing advanced plugins for image generators; and (v) by other means that Civitai may introduce. Buzz is not a substitute for fiat currency, Buzz does not earn interest, and has no equivalent value in fiat currency. Except as otherwise outlined in these Buzz Terms, Buzz cannot be redeemed for any fiat currency, and Civitai is not obligated to exchange a User’s Buzz for anything else of value.

**License to Buzz.** Your acquisition or purchase of Buzz only entitles you to receive a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use Buzz (i) in connection with the Services, (ii) for your personal entertainment only, and (iii) in the ways permitted under the Terms of Service. Your limited license to use Buzz may end if (i) you violate the Terms of Service; (ii) your Account is suspended or terminated; or (iii) with 30 days’ notice if these Buzz Terms or the Services is terminated, without payment, or liability to you. Except for the limited licenses granted to you under the Buzz Terms, Civitai retains all rights in and to Buzz. Civitai makes no guarantees or warranties regarding Buzz or their availability or value.

**Promotional Offers.** Civitai reserves the right to determine pricing for Buzz and may, at its sole discretion, make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any Users. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your purchase or use of Buzz.

**Prohibited Conduct.** You may not use, acquire, or distribute Buzz except
through the Services and except as expressly allowed by Civitai. Any attempt to do so constitutes a violation of the Terms of Service, will render the transaction void, and may result in the immediate suspension or termination of your Account and your license to use Buzz or the Service. Civitai does not recognize or take responsibility for third-party services that allow Users to sell, transfer, purchase, or otherwise use Buzz, and any such use by a User is a violation of the Terms of Service. Only Users who have reached the age of majority in their jurisdiction or state of residence may purchase Buzz or engage in other real-money transactions on the Services. Except as required by law, all payments for Buzz are final and not refundable. Civitai may implement changes to Buzz and these Buzz Terms at any time at Civitai’s sole discretion; this may include limiting the number of Buzz a User may acquire or lowering the purchase price of Buzz.

**Buzz Dashboard.** You can access and track your Buzz using the Buzz Dashboard page from either the Buzz dashboard link on the main menu, or by clicking your Buzz balance in the top left of the menu header. The My Buzz Dashboard page shows Recent Transactions, your Lifetime Buzz amount, and will list ways to earn (and use) your Buzz. Buzz may, in Civitai’s sole discretion be exchanged for fiat (“Cash Out”). Such Cash Out may require a minimum Buzz amount for conversion to fiat currency. Civitai reserves the right to determine the currency in which Buzz is exchanged. You are responsible for all transaction fees in connection with Cash Out transactions, if any, and these fees will vary depending on the payment method you choose. Furthermore, Civitai, in its sole discretion, will determine whether you are eligible to Cash Out by reviewing information on your Account, requirements under applicable law, and your compliance with the Terms of Service and these Buzz Terms.

**Eligibility to Cash Out.** Civitai may, at its discretion, place restrictions on your ability to Cash Out, reject any request you make to Cash Out, and determine how much you are eligible to Cash Out. For example, Civitai generally limits a User’s ability to Cash Out $1,000 or more per day and may deny your request to Cash Out more than that amount. Any User requesting to Cash Out $1,000 or more worth of Buzz in any given day will need to provide information to Civitai in order for Civitai to conduct certain checks and verifications on the User. This information may include, at Civitai’s discretion, your bank name and account, the address of your primary residence, your full legal name, a government-issued identification number, tax information (an IRS form W-9 for U.S. taxpayers and an IRS form W-8 for non-U.S. taxpayers), and copies or images of related documents (“Verification Documentation”). Civitai reserves the right to decline or cancel any Cash Out for any reason, including in the event that the Verification Documentation appears to be inaccurate, cannot be verified, does not uniquely identify you, or that a Cash Out request would be, as determined by Civitai at its discretion, inappropriate. For example, Civitai may deny Cash Out requests that involve suspected money laundering or suspicious or fraudulent account activity or payments of $1,000 or more in any given day. Certain age restrictions may also apply to the availability of Cash Out opportunities, depending on local laws and the policies of Civitai’s third-party vendors. Even if you request to Cash Out, you will only receive Civitai’s selected currency in exchange for Buzz held in your Account if Civitai determines, at its discretion, that you are eligible to Cash Out. Civitai also reserves the right to deny Cash Out payments to any User that Civitai determines, at its discretion, has violated these Buzz Terms or the Terms of Service in any way.

**Expiration and Modification of Buzz.** Notwithstanding any provision of these Buzz Terms to the contrary, if your Account is inactive for one-year, Civitai may close your Account and delete any Buzz balance. If Civitai terminates your Account for inactivity or otherwise, your license to all Buzz associated with your Account will terminate immediately and all Buzz associated with your Account will expire, without compensation of any kind to you, subject to any limitations or obligations under applicable law. Civitai reserves the right to modify, amend, or cancel these Buzz Terms, add, remove, or modify the eligibility requirements, and change the exchange rate for a Cash Out, in each case, at any time and for any reason. The existence of the Buzz Terms in no way creates an obligation for us to continue making Cash Outs available in the future, nor does it guarantee that a Cash Out payment can be made in the future, subject to applicable law. Civitai reserves the right to review activity on any Account to assess the validity of your eligibility to Cash Out.

**DISCLAIMERS.** NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES IN THE TERMS OF SERVICE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CIVITAI MAY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, AMEND, MODIFY, OR TERMINATE YOUR RIGHT TO BUZZ, INCLUDING TERMINATING YOUR ABILITY TO USE OR REDEEM BUZZ ALREADY ACCRUED, AT ANY TIME. THE ACCUMULATION OF ANY BUZZ IN YOUR ACCOUNT DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO ANY VESTED RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO ANY SPECIFIC AWARD OR BENEFIT. IN ACCUMULATING BUZZ, YOU MAY NOT RELY UPON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF ANY BUZZ OR RELATED BENEFIT, AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN BENEFITS FOR ALL OR ANY BUZZ.
