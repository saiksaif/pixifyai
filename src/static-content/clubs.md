title: Clubs disabled permanently
---

We've heard you. Based on your insightful feedback ([see here](https://civitai.com/articles/3636)), we've decided to permanently disable the Clubs feature. Your concerns about the potential pitfalls of Clubs were well-founded, and we're taking action.

While Clubs had its benefits, such as fostering community engagement and support for creators, we acknowledge that it wasn't the right approach for Civitai.

For those who've invested in Clubs, we've got you covered:
- If you're currently a club member, expect a full Buzz refund.
- If you purchased Buzz for club membership, please reach out to us at support@civitai.com for a refund.

Looking ahead, we're excited about new ways to support both our community and creators sustainably. Check out [our latest article](https://civitai.com/articles/3694) detailing our future plans. The article includes a survey that will help shape the future of Civitai, so please take a moment to review it and then take the survey.

Thank you for being a part of this journey. Let's continue to shape Civitai together.
